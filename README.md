# Ch-041 Development branch

1. Install node
2. Install MongoDB
3. Create folder for DB temp files (C:\MongoDB\data)
3. Run MongoDB (.\mongod.exe --dbpath "C:\MongoDB\data") 
4. Open project folder and run "npm start"

You can run "Sass-compiler" and "Scripts-concat" tasks by running "gulp" in the root folder". Gulp will then fire this tasks if the files have changed.
